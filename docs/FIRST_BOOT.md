# First Boot Checklist

After `mowglinext.sh` finishes and the containers come up, walk through this once per new install. Everything here is docked-only — nothing asks you to drive the mower.

## 1. GUI & diagnostics come up

- Open `http://<mower-ip>:4006` in a browser.
- In the **Diagnostics** panel, you should see (within 30–60 s of boot):
  - `hardware_bridge` → OK, serial link open.
  - `fusion` → publishing at ~100 Hz.
  - `gps` → publishing at 5 Hz. **Status: RTK Fixed** is the goal — keep reading if you are not there yet.
  - `lidar` (if enabled) → `/scan` publishing at ~10 Hz.
  - `kinematic_icp` (if LiDAR enabled) → publishing on `/kinematic_icp/lidar_odometry` at ~10 Hz.

## 2. RTK Fixed

MowgliNext expects centimetre-accurate GPS. Without it, area recording is noisy and strip coverage drifts between sessions.

1. Check `/gps/fix` in Foxglove or via `ros2 topic echo --once /gps/fix | grep status`.
2. `status=2` means GBAS/RTK Fixed — you are done.
3. `status=1` or `0` means you are on SBAS or a basic fix. The usual fixes, in order:
   - Confirm antenna has a clear sky view (no tree canopy, no metal overhang).
   - Confirm NTRIP credentials are correct (`install/.env` or `/ros2_ws/config/mowgli_robot.yaml` → `ntrip_host`, `ntrip_mountpoint`, `ntrip_user`, `ntrip_password`).
   - `ros2 topic hz /ntrip_client/rtcm` should print a rate around 50–60 Hz. If 0, the NTRIP client isn't getting RTCM.
   - If you move indoors or the sky view was bad at boot, the receiver may never converge — re-boot outdoors.

## 3. IMU calibration

- The first time the robot is charging on the dock, `hardware_bridge_node` runs a 20-second IMU calibration (1000 samples) and subtracts the mean bias from every subsequent reading.
- Look in the logs for:
  ```
  IMU calibration complete (1000 samples) ...
  Implied mounting tilt: pitch=+X.XX° roll=+X.XX° ...
  ```
- If `pitch` or `roll` is larger than ~1°, the IMU is physically mounted at an angle. Copy those values into `mowgli_robot.yaml` → `imu_pitch`, `imu_roll`, and recreate the container. Values under 1° are chip bias and are already removed by the calibration.

## 4. IMU yaw calibration (requires motion)

The IMU's heading relative to forward is not auto-detected — it has to be solved by driving the robot a short distance.

- Only do this step once you are physically at the robot and ready to catch it if anything goes wrong.
- GUI → **Diagnostics** → **Auto-calibrate IMU yaw** button. The robot drives 0.6 m forward then back and writes the solved `imu_yaw` into `mowgli_robot.yaml`.
- Make sure the robot is on a level patch of open ground with roughly 1 m clear in front and behind.

## 5. Dock pose

- Measure the dock's position relative to the GPS datum (the datum is automatically set to the first GPS fix received on first boot; after that it is pinned in `reference.x/y/z` under the FusionCore config).
- Set `dock_pose_x`, `dock_pose_y`, `dock_pose_yaw` in `mowgli_robot.yaml`.
- `dock_pose_yaw` is measured once with a phone compass pointing in the direction the mower faces when docked (reverse in → the tail is toward the dock, so the heading is the direction the mower points when it drives out).

## 6. Record a mowing area

- Drive the mower manually (GUI → **Record Area**) along the boundary.
- Finish recording — the polygon is Douglas–Peucker simplified and saved via `/map_server_node/add_area`.
- Repeat for every area you want to mow.

## 7. First autonomous mow

- GUI → **Start**. The behavior tree will:
  1. Clear the emergency latch if still held.
  2. Undock via Nav2 BackUp (1.5 m, 0.15 m/s).
  3. Iterate through each mowing area: plan the next strip, transit to its start, follow it with FTCController, repeat until the area is covered. Then move to the next area.
  4. Dock when all areas are done, or when battery drops below the low-battery threshold.
- Progress is persisted in the `mow_progress` grid layer and survives restarts, so if you hit Emergency mid-mow you can resume later.

## Not yet supported / coming soon

See the main [README](../README.md#not-planned--removed) for the authoritative list. Short version: headland passes, 3D slope-aware planning, multi-zone time-window scheduling, visual BT tree live viewer, fleet management, and the mobile app (PR #27) are all **coming soon**, not shipped today.
